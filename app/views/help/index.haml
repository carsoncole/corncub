        %h4 How do I do door-to-door sales?
        %p With door-to-door sales you'll be interacting with your neighbors, and since you are asking for their support, its important to proudly wear your full Scout uniform. Bring your order form, and introduce yourself. You could say "Hello, my name is John, and I am a Cub Scout with Pack 4496. I am raising money through the sale of popcorn for our Pack and to help me go to summer camp. Can I show you the popcorn we have?"

        %p If a neighbor decides to buy, make sure you record all of the details on your order form. Collect the money, and make sure you say how much you appreciate their support, such as "Thank you for your support".

        %h4 What are Take Orders?
        %p Take Orders are sales that you make door-to-door, in which neighbors choose popcorn and pay for items that will be delivered around October 15.

        %h4 Once I have taken an order, what do I do?
        %p Enter the details of the customer and the product sold on your order form. If you want to see a total of your sales, you can also enter them on this site. Once you turn in your order form and money, all your take orders will be shown on this site, so you can easily see where you need to deliver the popcorn product when we have it available.

        %h4 When will door-to-door take orders be delivered?
        %p You will need to pick up your deliveries on or around November 5. You will be notified by email when its available.

        %h4 Who and how how should I turn in my Take Orders order form and money to?
        %p Take Order order sheets and money can be give to your Den Leader or Carson Cole, when picking up/dropping off a Distribution Box at his home. If you have collected more than 20 orders, we ask that you turn in your order form and money and get a new one. The benefit to you is that all of your orders will be entered into CubCorn.us where you can track how your are doing.
